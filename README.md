# Encryptor-Decryptor
This is a project on encryption and decryption using playfair cipher. It takes a seven unique letter key and a variable length text to encrypt or decrypt.
It is written in c++ language and uses concepts from OOPS.

The Playfair cipher was the first practical digraph substitution cipher. The scheme was invented in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone but was named after Lord Playfair who promoted the use of the cipher. In playfair cipher unlike traditional cipher we encrypt a pair of alphabets(digraphs) instead of a single alphabet.
